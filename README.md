### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior at Rice studying math and computer science. 
Next fall, I'll be joining Plaid full time as a software engineer 
in their San Francisco office. My current interests and curiosities 
are: applied math, approximation algorithms for hard problems, 
computational geometry, and formal and natural language processing.
